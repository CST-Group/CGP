# 🧠 Cognitive Generative Planner (CGP)

A hybrid automated planning model based on Vector Embedding Representations and Transformer Architecture.

## 📌 Overview

The **Cognitive Generative Planner (CGP)** is an innovative hybrid planning system that integrates **symbolic** and **subsymbolic representations**, combining the expressiveness of symbolic reasoning with the generalization power of neural networks.

By leveraging **Ideas** (symbolic structures) and their vectorized counterpart **Vector Ideas**, CGP enables creative, scalable, and adaptive planning. The system is driven by a **Transformer-based neural architecture** and enhanced by a symbolic search component: the **Situated Beam Search (SBS)** algorithm.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Hybrid planning using **Ideas + Vector Ideas**
- Symbolic and subsymbolic knowledge integration
- **Transformer-based neural network**
- Novel **Situated Beam Search Algorithm (SBS)**
- Creative and explainable plan generation
- Evaluation in complex simulated environments

## 📊 Experimental Results

CGP was evaluated in dynamic simulation environments and demonstrated:

- High **accuracy** in valid plan generation
- High **diversity** in generated plans
- Lower computational cost than conventional planners
- Generalization across different planning contexts
